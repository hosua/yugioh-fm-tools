This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This calculator was made using information based on this [guide](https://www.neoseeker.com/forums/3085/t2018541-calculating-duel-rank/). If anything on here is unclear, please watch that guide. To use the app, visit this [link](https://hosua.github.io/yugioh-forbidden-memories-duel-calculator/).
